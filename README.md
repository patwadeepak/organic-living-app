# organic-living-app

React has been chosen as the core tech to build the UI for the App.

We want to build for mobile first. Thus, React Native it is.

----------- Alternates looked upon --------------
1. .NET MAUI - since BE will .NET based.
2. SolidJS - since it an improved UI framework vs React.

Why these were not chosen ?
1. Will be faster to do on React since I already know it.
2. SolidJS Native doesn't exist yet.
